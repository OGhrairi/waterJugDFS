# waterJugDFS - Algorithm Coursework
This is a piece of coursework for my degree, in which we were tasked with modelling the water-jug-problem, [Similar to this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-water-jug-problem)
and implementing a depth-first-search algorithm to find either all possible states, or a given goal state.
For this particular instance of the problem, it was assumed that there are three jugs, of volumes to be entered by the user, and then
a goal state that was an optional entry by the user.
